## **COMPLETE PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE**

### **System Architecture Overview**

The AlphaFrame Galileo V2.2 system consists of four primary layers:

**Frontend Layer (React + TypeScript)** includes a professional design system with reusable components, comprehensive state management with Zustand and persistence, and progressive web app capabilities for offline functionality.

**Intelligence Layer (Client-Side Processing)** contains the tax optimization engine, debt management engine, retirement forecasting engine, Monte Carlo simulation engine, and explainability engine for clear insight generation.

**Security Layer (Zero-Knowledge Architecture)** implements field-level encryption with AES-256, client-side processing for privacy, secure data storage, and comprehensive audit trail systems.

**Integration Layer (External Services)** connects to Plaid API for banking data, tax calculation APIs, market data APIs, and export services for comprehensive functionality.

### **Folder Structure & Organization**

The application structure follows a modular, scalable architecture:

**Core Services** include PlaidService for banking data integration, CryptoService for field-level encryption, TaxService for tax optimization, DebtService for debt management, RetirementService for retirement forecasting, MonteCarloRunner for simulation engine, ExplainabilityEngine for AI explainability, ExecutionLogService for audit trails, ComplianceAuditLayer for legal compliance, AccessControlService for tier management, InsightFeedSchema for data contracts, and PlannerTestScenarioBuilder for testing framework.

**State Management** consists of useAppStore for main application state, plannerState for planner-specific state, encryptionState for security state, and userState for user preferences.

**Components** are organized into design-system for reusable UI components, planner for financial planning tools, dashboard for main dashboard interface, and shared for common components.

**Pages** include HomePage, DashboardPage, ProPlannerPage, OnboardingPage, and SettingsPage for complete application routing.

**Styles** contain design-tokens.css for design system tokens, global.css for global styles, and themes for theme variations.

**Tests** provide comprehensive testing with unit, integration, e2e, and visual-regression testing capabilities.

### **Data Flow Architecture**

The data flow follows a secure, validated path: User Input flows through Validation, then Encryption, Processing, Explainability, Storage, and finally UI Update. Each step ensures data integrity, security, and user experience quality.
