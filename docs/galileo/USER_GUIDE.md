## ‚öôÔ∏è Rule Engine

### What are Financial Rules?

Financial rules are like **automatic instructions** for your money. They watch your transactions and take action when certain conditions are met.

**Example:** "If I spend more than $100 on dining out, send me a reminder to review my budget."

### Creating Your First Rule

#### Step 1: Choose a Trigger
A trigger is what starts your rule. Common triggers include:
- **Transaction Amount** - When you spend or receive money
- **Merchant Category** - When you shop at specific types of stores
- **Date/Time** - On specific dates or recurring intervals
- **Account Balance** - When your account reaches certain levels

#### Step 2: Set Conditions
Conditions are the specific criteria your rule looks for:
- **Amount:** $50, $100, $500, etc.
- **Category:** Dining, Shopping, Transportation, etc.
- **Merchant:** Specific store names
- **Frequency:** Daily, weekly, monthly

#### Step 3: Choose an Action
Actions are what happens when your rule triggers:
- **Notification** - Get an alert or reminder
- **Budget Adjustment** - Automatically adjust spending limits
- **Savings Transfer** - Move money to savings
- **Report Generation** - Create a summary report

### Advanced Rule Features

#### Multiple Conditions
You can combine conditions with AND, OR, and NOT logic:

**Example:** "If I spend more than $100 AND it's at a restaurant OR coffee shop, then send a reminder."

#### Compound Rules
Create complex rules that trigger multiple actions:

**Example:** "If I spend over $200 on entertainment in a week, then send a warning AND transfer $50 to savings."

### Rule Management
