- `src/lib/services/RuleExecutionEngine.js` - Evaluate rules against real data

### **New Files to Create**
- `src/lib/services/PlaidErrorHandler.js` - Handle Plaid-specific errors
- `src/lib/services/TransactionProcessor.js` - Process real transaction data
- `src/types/PlaidTypes.ts` - TypeScript types for Plaid integration

### **Configuration Requirements**
- Plaid production API credentials
- OAuth redirect URLs configured
- Webhook endpoints for transaction updates
- Error monitoring and logging setup

---

## 📊 **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] OAuth flow completes in <30 seconds
- [ ] Transaction sync completes in <60 seconds
- [ ] Rule evaluation against real data in <5 seconds
- [ ] Dashboard updates within 10 seconds of new transactions
- [ ] Error recovery in <15 seconds

### **Reliability Requirements**

## 🚨 **CONTINGENCY PLAN**

### **If Plaid Integration Fails After 14 Days**
1. **Fallback to Phase 6:** Implement Simulation Mode v1
2. **Accelerate Phase 9:** Focus on E2E flows with simulation data
3. **Alternative Options:** Evaluate other banking integration providers
4. **Timeline Adjustment:** Extend Phase 5 deadline by 7 days

### **If OAuth Flow Fails**
1. **Debug OAuth Configuration:** Check redirect URLs and credentials
2. **Test with Plaid Sandbox:** Validate integration with test data
3. **Implement Fallback:** Use manual account entry as backup
4. **Document Issues:** Create troubleshooting guide

### **If Transaction Sync Fails**
1. **Check API Limits:** Verify Plaid API rate limits
2. **Implement Retry Logic:** Add exponential backoff for failed syncs
3. **Cache Strategy:** Implement transaction caching
4. **User Communication:** Clear error messages and next steps
