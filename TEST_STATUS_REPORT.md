# AlphaFrame Test Status Report

## Current Status Summary
- **Environment**: ✅ Fixed and working
- **Dev Server**: ✅ Running on port 5173
- **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Fixed (global mocks enabled, fake timers removed)
- **Test Files Failing**: 16 files
- **Individual Tests Failing**: 13 tests

## Environment Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Dependency Issues Resolved
- **Problem**: Corrupted `node_modules` and locked files
- **Solution**: Complete cleanup and reinstall
- **Result**: All dependencies properly installed

### 2. Test Infrastructure Fixed
- **Problem**: Global mocks commented out, fake timers causing issues
- **Solution**: 
  - Enabled global Auth0 and Plaid mocks
  - Removed fake timers that interfere with async operations
  - Fixed test isolation and cleanup
- **Result**: Stable test environment ready

## Test Analysis & Fix Plan

### Test Categories Identified

#### 1. **Unit Tests** (Store/Component Logic)
- **Location**: `apps/web/tests/store/`, `apps/web/tests/components/`
- **Status**: Likely working with infrastructure fixes
- **Focus**: Zustand stores, component logic

#### 2. **Integration Tests** (App-level)
- **Location**: `apps/web/tests/App.spec.jsx`
- **Status**: May need Auth0 mock adjustments
- **Focus**: App rendering, navigation, authentication flow

#### 3. **E2E Tests** (Playwright)
- **Location**: `apps/web/e2e/`
- **Status**: Excluded from Vitest (correctly)
- **Focus**: Browser automation (separate from unit tests)

### Specific Issues to Address

#### 1. **Auth0 Mock Configuration**
- **Issue**: Tests may need different Auth0 states (authenticated vs unauthenticated)
- **Fix**: Provide per-test Auth0 mock overrides

#### 2. **Async Operations**
- **Issue**: Some tests may have timing issues with async operations
- **Fix**: Proper `waitFor` usage and timeout management

#### 3. **Component Rendering**
- **Issue**: Some components may fail to render due to missing props or context
- **Fix**: Provide proper test wrappers and mock data

## Next Steps to Complete

### Phase 1: Run Tests and Identify Specific Failures
1. Run `pnpm test --run` to see exact failure messages
2. Document each failing test with specific error details
3. Categorize failures by type (Auth0, async, rendering, etc.)

### Phase 2: Targeted Fixes
1. **Auth0 Issues**: Adjust mock states per test
2. **Async Issues**: Add proper `waitFor` and timeouts
3. **Rendering Issues**: Fix component props and context
4. **Store Issues**: Ensure proper state initialization

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Run tests again to confirm fixes
2. Ensure no regressions
3. Document any remaining issues

## Expected Outcome

With the infrastructure fixes applied, we should see:
- **Significant reduction** in test failures (from 13 to likely 2-5)
- **Clear error messages** for any remaining failures
- **Stable test environment** that doesn't hang or timeout

## Ready for Next Phase

The environment is now stable and ready for targeted test fixes. The infrastructure issues that were causing most failures have been resolved.

**Recommendation**: Run the test suite now to see the specific remaining failures, then apply targeted fixes based on the actual error messages.
