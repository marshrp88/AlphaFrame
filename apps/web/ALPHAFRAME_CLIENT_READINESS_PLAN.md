## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Authentication Architecture**
```javascript
// Auth0 Configuration
const auth0Config = {
  domain: process.env.VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN,
  clientId: process.env.VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
  audience: process.env.VITE_AUTH0_AUDIENCE,
  redirectUri: window.location.origin,
  scope: 'openid profile email read:financial_data write:financial_data'
};

// User Session Management
const useAuthStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  isLoading: true,
  login: async () => { /* Auth0 login */ },
  logout: async () => { /* Auth0 logout */ },
  updateProfile: async (data) => { /* Profile update */ }
}));
```

### **Plaid Integration**
```javascript
// Plaid Service
class PlaidService {
  async createLinkToken(userId) {
    // Create Plaid Link token
  }
  
  async exchangePublicToken(publicToken) {
    // Exchange for access token
  }
  
  async getTransactions(accessToken, startDate, endDate) {
    // Fetch real transactions
  }
  
  async getAccounts(accessToken) {
    // Get account information
  }
}
```

### **Rule Engine**
```javascript
// Rule Execution Engine
class RuleEngine {
  async evaluateRule(rule, transaction) {
    // Evaluate rule against transaction
  }
  
  async executeAction(action, transaction) {
    // Execute rule action
  }
