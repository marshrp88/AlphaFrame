## 📝 Summary

**Helios VX.3 is technically complete and CI-stable, but requires production readiness validation before market release.**

**Current Status**: 🔒 **HOLD** - Do not proceed to public or partner release yet
**Internal Use**: ✅ Safe for engineering handoff and Galileo planning
**Next Check**: Post QA validation, run final review before launch
