## **Conclusion**

The Helios Initiative is progressing well with significant achievements in Track B (Frontend & Polish) and solid foundations in Track A (Design & Identity). The systematic approach has resulted in:

- **40% overall completion** with strong momentum
- **67% completion in Track B** (Frontend & Polish) - the most technical track
- **Comprehensive design token system** providing consistent foundation
- **Modern dashboard implementation** with CSS Grid and WhatsNext hero
- **Refactored major views** using new UI components

The remaining work focuses on design deliverables (Track A), content creation (Track C), and final polish with user validation. The foundation is solid and the path to completion is clear.

**Next milestone target**: 60% overall completion by end of next sprint, with focus on completing Track B and advancing Track A design deliverables.
