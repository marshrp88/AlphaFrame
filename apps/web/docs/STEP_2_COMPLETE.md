## **ðŸŽ¯ Content Transformation Impact**

### **Before (Developer Jargon)**
```
"Initialize your FrameSync automation rules to optimize your financial workflow. Configure transaction triggers and execute automated transfers based on your predefined parameters."
```

### **After (User-Centric)**

```

### **Key Improvements:**
- âœ… **Removed technical terms** (initialize, configure, execute, parameters)
- âœ… **Focused on benefits** (automatically manage, simple rules)
- âœ… **Used concrete examples** (specific dollar amounts and conditions)
- âœ… **Made it actionable** (clear next steps)
