# AlphaFrame Critical Path to Customer Readiness

---

## ðŸš¦ Canonical Directive (Effective January 2025)

**This document is the canonical strategic execution roadmap for all engineering and design work from January to April 2025.**

- **Supersession:** This roadmap supersedes all previous roadmaps (Helios, Phase X, Galileo 1.0) unless explicitly amended by leadership.
- **Preconditions:**
  1. At least one user-defined rule must execute successfully against either mock or real data and produce a visible dashboard insight.
  2. The onboarding flow must guide a user through rule setup that triggers an actual system response.
  3. Plaid production integration must be live, OR simulation mode must mimic production-grade data fidelity.
- **No new design systems, performance tuning, onboarding animations, or UI refreshes are to be started until the above preconditions are met.**
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Begin execution on Phase 1: Functional Rule Execution Layer.
  - Prepare reporting infrastructure to monitor:
    - Rule trigger rates
    - Time to insight
    - Simulation vs. real data adoption
    - Dropoff during onboarding or rule creation
  - Ensure all progress is trackable, composable, and logged at the file/component level.
