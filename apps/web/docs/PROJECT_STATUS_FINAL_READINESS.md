## 1. Backend Engine Exposure
- **What's Done:**
  - All core services (BudgetService, RuleEngine, PortfolioAnalyzer, ExecutionLogService, SimulationService) are implemented and tested.
  - Pseudocode and contract templates are documented for each service (see SERVICE_PSEUDOCODE.md).
  - Encryption, schema versioning, and logging are enforced at the service layer.
- **What's Exposed:**
  - All business logic is accessible via the UI and API endpoints.
  - Real Plaid and webhook integrations are in place (no longer mocked).
- **Outstanding:**
  - Some integration tests for edge cases and error handling are still in progress.

## 2. Authentication
- **What's Done:**
  - OAuth 2.0 authentication (Auth0) is fully integrated.
  - Session management uses JWT tokens, with persistent login and logout flows.
  - Role-based permissions are enforced in both frontend (PrivateRoute) and backend (API endpoints).
- **Security:**
  - All API requests require valid tokens; secrets are managed per environment.
  - Security best practices (TLS, AES-256, PBKDF2) are followed (see SECURITY_PERFORMANCE_TODO.md).
- **Outstanding:**
  - Some warning states for missing secrets in dev/staging, but production is locked down.

## 3. Customer Flow
- **What's Done:**
  - Multi-step onboarding, dashboard, and feedback modules are implemented.
  - Onboarding flow triggers on first login or when user is not "onboarded".
  - Feedback module allows export of logs and insights (no backend upload for MVP).
- **Outstanding:**
  - Some edge cases (e.g., interrupted onboarding, error recovery) need more E2E coverage.
  - Visual polish and accessibility review are in progress.

## 4. UI/API Binding
- **What's Done:**
  - Most UI components are bound to real API endpoints (Plaid, notifications, user data).
  - Error boundaries and loading states are present for most flows.
  - Zod schema validation is used for all API payloads and responses.
- **Outstanding:**
  - Some legacy UI elements may still reference mock data or have incomplete error handling.
  - Full E2E test suite is not yet passing at 100% (see test-audit.md).

## 5. Definition of "Functional" (VX.1)
- **Functional means:**
  - All core user journeys (onboarding, dashboard, rule creation, simulation, feedback) can be completed without fatal errors.
  - All business logic is exercised through the UI and API, with real data and authentication.
  - All critical integrations (Plaid, webhooks, notifications) are live, not mocked.
  - Security, schema validation, and error boundaries are enforced throughout.
  - 90%+ of automated tests pass, with no critical blockers.
- **Not yet functional if:**
  - Any core journey is blocked by a crash, missing data, or authentication failure.
  - E2E test suite fails on critical flows (see test-audit.md for current blockers).

## Conclusion & Next Steps
- AlphaFrame VX.1 is **very close to production-ready**. All core logic, authentication, and integrations are in place.
- Remaining work is mostly in E2E polish, error edge cases, and final UI/API binding for legacy or rarely-used flows.
- **Next Steps:**
  1. Complete E2E Playwright validation and resolve any remaining test blockers.
  2. Review and polish onboarding and feedback flows for edge cases and accessibility.
  3. Finalize documentation and update all status trackers (test-audit.md, KNOWN_TEST_FAILURES.md).
  4. Prepare for Phase X: UX/UI refinement and public launch.
