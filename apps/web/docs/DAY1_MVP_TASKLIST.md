# Day 1 MVP Action Plan

This checklist will help you start strong and stay focused as you build out the MVP on the feat/react-pivot branch.

---

## 1. Service Implementation
- [ ] Review pseudocode templates for each service (Crypto, Sync, Rule, Simulation)
- [ ] Implement core logic for CryptoService (encryption, decryption)
- [ ] Implement core logic for SyncEngine (fetch, normalize, store data)
- [ ] Implement core logic for RuleEngine (evaluate, execute, validate rules)
- [ ] Implement core logic for SimulationService (run projections)
- [ ] Write/expand unit and integration tests as you go

## 2. API Integration
- [ ] Insert real API keys and credentials (Plaid, auth, etc.)
- [ ] Replace mock API calls with real ones in service files
- [ ] Test error handling using the API error handling checklist
- [ ] Handle edge cases (timeouts, invalid data, rate limits)

## 3. UI/UX Polish
- [ ] Review all screens using the UI/UX checklist
- [ ] Add/verify loading, error, and success states
- [ ] Check accessibility (keyboard, color contrast, ARIA)

## 4. Security & Performance
- [ ] Complete all items in the security/performance TODO list
- [ ] Run dependency audit (`npm audit` or `yarn audit`)
- [ ] Test with realistic data sizes

## 5. Final Review
- [ ] Run all tests and ensure 100% pass rate
- [ ] Review documentation for accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Prepare for demo or deployment
