# AlphaFrame VX.1 Engineering Execution Plan

**Document Type:** Finalized Engineering Plan for Customer-Ready Product Delivery  
**Version:** VX.1  
**Status:** Approved for Implementation  
**Branch:** `feat/vx1-restart`  
**Date:** December 2024

---

## ‚úÖ **Objective**

Fully integrate AlphaFrame's robust internal financial logic with external API services and user authentication systems to deliver a customer-ready, differentiated financial management product. This will position AlphaFrame for a seamless transition into UX/UI finalization (Phase X).

## üõ†Ô∏è **Engineering Tasks**

### Phase 1: External API & Data Integration (High Priority)

#### **Plaid API Integration**
- Implement secure Plaid OAuth connection flow
- Replace mock endpoints with Plaid sandbox integration
- Full transaction synchronization and categorization testing

#### **Webhook & Notification Integrations**
- Real endpoint implementations for email notifications and webhook triggers
- Develop robust error handling and retry mechanisms

#### **API Key and Secrets Management**
- Establish secure, environment-specific secret handling (`dev`, `staging`, `production`)
- Implement secure key rotation strategy (AWS Secrets Manager recommended)

### Phase 2: User Authentication & Authorization (High Priority)

#### **Authentication System**
- Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication (e.g., Auth0 or AWS Cognito)
- Full session management with persistent JWT tokens

#### **User Management**
- Integrate authentication state with `useAuthStore`
- Role-based permissions with real backend enforcement
- User data persistence tied to secure sessions

### Phase 3: Environment & Deployment Strategy (Critical)

#### **Environment Setup**
- Establish clear separation between `dev`, `staging`, and `production` environments
- Configure separate Plaid credentials, secrets, and API endpoints per environment

#### **Deployment Automation (CI/CD)**
- Implement automated deployments with GitHub Actions (testing ‚Üí staging ‚Üí production)
- Integrate automated end-to-end tests into deployment pipeline

### Phase 4: Performance & Load Testing (Medium Priority)

#### **Load Testing**
- Use `k6` or `Artillery` to simulate concurrent sessions and API load
- Benchmark key services (BudgetService, RuleEngine, PortfolioAnalyzer)
- Identify and optimize bottlenecks prior to production deployment

### Phase 5: Schema & Data Migration (Medium Priority)

#### **Schema Versioning**
- Version and migrate schemas for `IndexedDB` and `localStorage`
- Ensure backward compatibility during schema updates
- Automate migration procedures during app initialization

### Phase 6: Real User Validation & Feedback Loop (Medium Priority)

#### **Pilot User Group**
- Conduct a one-week closed beta with selected user group
- Gather quantitative usage metrics and qualitative feedback
- Incorporate feedback into final product adjustments prior to Phase X
