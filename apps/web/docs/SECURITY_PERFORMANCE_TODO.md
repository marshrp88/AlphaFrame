# Security & Performance TODO List

This document lists important security and performance tasks to complete before releasing your MVP.

---

## Security
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API requests
- [ ] Store API keys and secrets securely (never in client code)
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Hash passwords using PBKDF2 or bcrypt
- [ ] Validate all user input on both client and server
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Log security events (logins, failed attempts, etc.)
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review and follow security best practices

---

## Performance
- [ ] Optimize images and assets for fast loading
- [ ] Minimize JavaScript bundle size
- [ ] Use code splitting and lazy loading for large modules
- [ ] Cache API responses where appropriate
- [ ] Debounce or throttle rapid user actions (e.g., search, typing)
- [ ] Test app with realistic data sizes
- [ ] Monitor app performance (load time, responsiveness)
- [ ] Remove unused code and dependencies
