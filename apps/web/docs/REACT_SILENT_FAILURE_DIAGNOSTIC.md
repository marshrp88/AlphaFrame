# React Silent Failure Diagnostic Report – AlphaFrame VX.1

## Objective
Diagnose why importing `App.jsx` into `main.jsx` causes the React app to fail silently in a Vite + React + Playwright environment, even though a minimal React mount works. The goal is to isolate the exact import, side-effect, or initialization logic in `App.jsx` (or its dependency chain) that breaks module execution and prevents React from rendering.

---

## Diagnostic Methodology
1. **Start Minimal:** Reset `App.jsx` to only import React and render `<h1>Test App Rendered</h1>`.
2. **Incremental Import:** Reintroduce each import in `App.jsx` one by one, adding `console.log()` before and after each import.
3. **Test After Each Change:** After each import, run `npx playwright test apps/web/e2e/vx1-comprehensive-validation.spec.js` to check if rendering still works.
4. **Stop at Failure:** When rendering fails or logs disappear, mark the last import as the likely culprit.
5. **Deep Dive:** Repeat the process inside the failing import's file to isolate the exact line or side-effect.
6. **Confirm:** Isolate the suspected line in a sandbox test to confirm it causes the failure.

## Step-by-Step Isolation Log
- **Step 1:** Minimal `App.jsx` (only React, `<h1>Test App Rendered</h1>`) – ✅ Renders fine.
- **Step 2:** Add `BrowserRouter` import – ✅ Still renders.
- **Step 3:** Add `useAuthStore` import – ✅ Still renders.
- **Step 4:** Add next import (repeat for each import in original `App.jsx`) – ⏳ Continue until failure.
- **Step 5:** When failure occurs, note which import caused it. Dive into that file and repeat the process.

*Note: The actual import tree and results should be filled in as the process is executed. Below is a template for recording findings.*

## Import Tree & Results
| Import Path                        | Status  | Notes / Logs Present?                |
|------------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| React                             | ✅ Safe | Always safe                          |
| BrowserRouter (react-router-dom)  | ✅ Safe | Renders fine                         |
| useAuthStore (core/store/authStore)| ✅ Safe | Renders fine                         |
| ... (add each import in order)    | ...     | ...                                  |
| [FaultyImport]                    | ❌ Fail | Rendering breaks, logs disappear     |

## Root Cause Explanation (Example)
- **Faulty Import:** `[FaultyImport]`
- **Root Cause:** (e.g., circular dependency, undefined variable, infinite loop, rejected promise, side-effect in module scope, etc.)
- **How It Breaks:** (Describe how/why this causes React to fail silently in the browser.)

---

## Refactor Strategy
- **Isolate Side-Effects:** Move any side-effectful code (e.g., API calls, state mutations) inside React effects or functions, not module scope.
- **Break Cycles:** Refactor to remove circular dependencies between modules.
- **Add Guards:** Add null/undefined checks and error boundaries around risky logic.
- **Test in Isolation:** Use sandbox tests for any complex or critical import.
- **Document:** Update README and code comments to warn about the root cause and how to avoid it in the future.

---

## Conclusion & Next Steps
- Continue the import isolation process until the exact faulty line is found.
- Once isolated, refactor as recommended and confirm React mounts successfully in all environments.
- Update this doc with the final root cause and solution for future reference.

*This diagnostic process is essential for robust production readiness and will help prevent similar silent failures in future releases.*
