## II. üî¨ Deep Technical Findings by Audit Category

### 1. ‚úÖ **Test Coverage & CI Reliability**

* **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully passing test suite (`483/483`)
* **Tools**: Jest, mock infrastructure, `pnpm exec --ci`
* **Weakness**: No negative-path mutation tests (e.g., Plaid errors, broken rules)
* **Recommendation**: Add 3‚Äì5 tests covering failure state logic to ensure durability

---

### 2. ‚ùå **Security & Privacy Assurance**

* **Gaps**:
  * No simulated attacker tests
  * No static analysis or penetration sweep
  * Unknown behavior of logs under error or replay conditions
* **Immediate Need**:
  * Harden execution logs (no PII)
  * Run local pen test suite (Burp/ZAP or equivalent)
  * Audit SecureVault boundary logic

---

### 3. ‚ùå **Mobile UX Validation**

* **Status**: Untested on hardware
* **Required Devices**:
  * iOS Safari (iPhone X, SE)
  * Android Chrome (Pixel emulator or Samsung)
* **Target Outcome**:
  * Onboarding flow usable
  * No scroll traps
  * Inputs and dashboard responsive

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Accessibility & Lighthouse**

* **Status**: No Lighthouse log; A11y only partially validated
* **Required Tests**:
  * Run Lighthouse on `localhost:3000`
  * Validate ARIA roles on top 5 pages
  * Tab navigation from Login ‚Üí Rule Setup ‚Üí Dashboard

---

### 5. ‚ùå **User Flow Recovery & Resilience**

* **Test Missing**:
  * Simulated network interruptions
  * User reload mid-onboarding
* **Risk**: If onboarding fails or disconnects, state may be lost
* **Required Fix**: Add `sessionStorage` checkpoint + resume handler

---

### 6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Developer Onboarding**

* **Gap**: `pnpm dev` and `pnpm install` unverified on fresh clone
* **Solution**: Run in containerized or test machine environment, update `README.md`
* **Deliverable**: Ensure total setup <15min, no global dependency

---

### 7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Non-Technical User Readiness**

* **Gap**: No real-world usability test with first-time, non-technical users
* **Requirement**: Must complete onboarding, see InsightCard in <5 mins
* **Suggestion**: Run 3 trial sessions and document friction points

---

### 8. ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI/Content Completion**

* **Gap**: Placeholder checks not logged
* **Remediation**: Audit `.jsx` files for "lorem," "TODO," and dev-only labels
* **Goal**: Fully polished interface for screenshots, investor demo

## P1: Network Resilience & Interrupted Onboarding Checklist & Test Script

**Purpose:** Ensure AlphaFrame gracefully handles slow/interrupted networks and recovers user state after disconnects or reloads.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Slow Network Simulation**
   - Use Chrome DevTools or device settings to throttle network to 3G/Slow 4G
   - Complete onboarding and dashboard navigation
   - Confirm all UI elements load (with spinners or skeletons as needed)
   - No infinite spinners or blank screens

2. **Interrupted Onboarding**
   - Begin onboarding, then disconnect network (airplane mode or DevTools offline)
   - Attempt to proceed; app should show a clear error or retry prompt
   - Reconnect and reload; onboarding should resume at last completed step

3. **Session State Recovery**
   - Complete part of onboarding, then close/reopen browser or app
   - App should restore user to last completed step, not restart from scratch

4. **Dashboard Data Recovery**
   - On dashboard, disconnect and reconnect network
   - App should retry data fetches and recover without requiring full reload

**Instructions for QA:**
- Use real devices or emulators with network throttling
- Record screen or take screenshots of any failures
- Log bugs with:
  - Device/OS/Browser
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual result
  - Screenshot/video

**Expected Outcomes:**
- No user data loss during onboarding or dashboard use
- Clear, actionable error messages on network failure
- Automatic or user-initiated recovery after reconnect
- No infinite loading or UI lockups

**Next Steps:**
- Distribute this checklist to QA team
- Collect results and log issues
- Resolve all critical issues before marking Network Resilience as complete

## P2: Lighthouse + Accessibility Audit Checklist & Test Script

**Purpose:** Ensure AlphaFrame meets accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) and achieves a Lighthouse A11y score >80.

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Lighthouse Audit**
   - Open Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse
   - Run audit for Accessibility on main routes (onboarding, dashboard, feedback)
   - Record A11y score for each route
   - Download and archive report

2. **Manual Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab through all interactive elements on each page
   - Ensure logical tab order, visible focus, and no keyboard traps
   - All buttons, links, and form fields must be accessible by keyboard

3. **Screen Reader Test**
   - Use VoiceOver (Mac/iOS) or NVDA/TalkBack (Windows/Android)
   - Confirm all interactive elements have descriptive labels
   - All ARIA roles and attributes are present and correct
   - No "unlabeled button" or "unknown" elements

4. **Color Contrast & Visual Clarity**
   - Use Lighthouse and manual checks to confirm text/background contrast >4.5:1
   - No critical information conveyed by color alone

**Instructions for QA:**
- Use latest Chrome for Lighthouse; use real devices for screen reader
- Record A11y score, screenshots, and any issues found
- Log bugs with:
  - Route/page
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual result
  - Screenshot/video

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Lighthouse A11y score >80 on all main routes
- All interactive elements accessible by keyboard and screen reader

   - Observe (without helping) as they:
     - Complete all onboarding steps
     - Reach the dashboard and see their personalized view
     - Attempt to submit feedback using the Feedback Form
   - Record any points of confusion, hesitation, or error

3. **Data to Collect**
   - Time to complete onboarding (target: <5 minutes)
   - Steps where user hesitates or asks for help
   - Any errors, unclear instructions, or UI issues

   - Do not use any global dependencies not listed in README

2. **Install & Setup**
   - Follow README instructions exactly (no prior knowledge)
   - Run all setup scripts (e.g., `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm exec jest --ci`)
   - Attempt to start the dev server and run tests

3. **Expected Outcomes:**
   - All dependencies install without errors
   - Dev server starts and app loads at localhost

   - No missing environment variables or undocumented steps

4. **Instructions for QA/Dev:**
   - Take notes/screenshots of any issues or unclear steps
   - Log bugs with:
     - Step where issue occurred
     - Error message or problem
     - Expected vs. actual result
     - Screenshot if possible

**Next Steps:**
- Run the setup walkthrough
