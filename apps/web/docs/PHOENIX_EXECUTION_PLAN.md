**🎉 PHOENIX INITIATIVE V3.1 STATUS: 100% COMPLETE**

**Summary:**
> The Phoenix Initiative V3.1 is now 100% complete. AlphaFrame has been transformed from a technical platform into a fully customer-ready, investor-validatable, and monetizable product. All phases (1-5) have been successfully executed, delivering a complete user experience with professional polish, smooth animations, and immediate value demonstration. The app is now ready for the Galileo Initiative and production deployment.

---

## I. Strategic Context

AlphaFrame's backend architecture, automation engine, rule evaluation logic, and onboarding pipeline are functionally complete. However, the product lacks the UX, navigability, visual polish, error resilience, and monetization surface required to deliver value to actual users.

This plan formalizes a **four-phase execution sprint**, resolving all remaining productization gaps and achieving **100/100 customer readiness** across functional, visual, interactive, accessibility, and commercial dimensions.

---

## II. Productization Execution Roadmap

### 🔁 Phase 0 – Foundation & Design System Hardening

**Duration**: 3 Days
**Purpose**: Formalize AlphaFrame's brand, design tokens, spacing system, and visual identity across all screens.

| Task | Deliverable                                                                                                                 |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0.1  | Create `brand.json` and `tokens.css`: defines primary colors, gradients, font scales, spacing scales, shadows, border radii |
| 0.2  | Apply tokens to all components in `/components/ui` and `/components/shared`                                                 |
| 0.3  | Implement global visual defaults in `tailwind.config.js` (or design system CSS layer)                                       |
| 0.4  | Create Figma parity file: maps token grid to all reusable components                                                        |
| 0.5  | Add visual theme test screen: `/design-system` route for dev-only use                                                       |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* All styled components use centralized tokens
* Visual language is consistent across pages
* Design mock parity is confirmed in Figma

---

### 🧭 Phase 1 – Navigation, Routing & Page Scaffolds

**Duration**: 1 Week
**Purpose**: Build complete, routable shell of the app. Ensure every button leads somewhere and every route is testable.

| Task | Deliverable                                                                                                    |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.1  | Build `AppRouter.jsx` with full route map: `/`, `/dashboard`, `/rules`, `/profile`, `/settings`, `/onboarding` |
| 1.2  | Build 5 full-page shells: `DashboardPage`, `RulesPage`, `ProfilePage`, `SettingsPage`, `404Page`               |
| 1.3  | Connect sidebar and top nav: clicking routes correctly updates page view                                       |
| 1.4  | Build global layout: header, nav, content with mobile-first responsiveness                                     |
| 1.5  | Add `FrameSync` interaction preview button to `RulesPage` for sandbox usage                                    |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* Navigating via sidebar/topnav renders correct pages
* Each route stub renders live without errors
* E2E test passes for all route transitions

### ✨ Phase 2 – Onboarding, First Rule & First Value

**Duration**: 1.5 Weeks
**Purpose**: Ensure first-time users reach value within 2 minutes via account connection + rule creation.

| Task | Deliverable                                                                                |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2.1  | Build `OnboardingFlow.jsx`: 4-step wizard → welcome → mock account → create rule → success |
| 2.2  | Implement persistent `onboardingState` in localStorage/stateStore                          |
| 2.3  | Redirect new users to onboarding; returning users land on `DashboardPage`                  |
| 2.4  | Add "Create First Rule" modal to onboarding step 3                                         |
| 2.5  | When complete, redirect to `/dashboard` with success banner and first rule visible         |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* First-time users complete onboarding within 2 minutes
* At least one rule is created and visible post-onboarding
* "Aha!" moment achieved (visible insight or simulation rendered)

---

### 🎨 Phase 3 – Visual Polish, Animation, UX Delight

**Duration**: 1 Week
**Purpose**: Make the app visually impressive and emotionally engaging.

| Task | Deliverable                                                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3.1  | Integrate `framer-motion` for page transitions, modal fades, tooltip reveals |
| 3.2  | Apply consistent layout spacing, visual hierarchy, button styling            |
| 3.3  | Polish empty states: rules, dashboard, profile (with illustrations)          |
| 3.4  | Add hover, pressed, success, and error feedback to all buttons               |
| 3.5  | Add animated skeleton loaders for simulations and insights                   |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* Transitions are smooth, interfaces feel responsive
* All states (loading, error, success) have visual feedback
* Visual hierarchy makes app feel premium and clear

---

### 📱 Phase 4 – Mobile, A11y, Resilience & Readiness

**Duration**: 1 Week
**Purpose**: Ensure app performs well across real devices and is production-resilient.

| Task | Deliverable                                                          |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4.1  | Manually QA app on iOS Safari, Android Chrome, and tablets           |
| 4.2  | Add keyboard nav and ARIA attributes to all inputs, modals, buttons  |
| 4.3  | Run Lighthouse audits on `/`, `/dashboard`, `/rules`, `/profile`     |
| 4.4  | Simulate offline & slow 3G: onboarding and dashboard fail gracefully |
| 4.5  | Add 404 fallback route and toast error for route mismatches          |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* Lighthouse scores >90 across A11y and Performance
* App passes keyboard nav test
* No crash in mobile or throttled network conditions

---

### 💸 Phase 5 – Monetization, Billing Stub, and Upgrade Path

**Duration**: 3 Days
**Purpose**: Introduce visual surface for AlphaFrame Pro; do not delay with real Stripe integration yet.

| Task | Deliverable                                                                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5.1  | Add `/settings/billing` route with upgrade-to-Pro visual CTA                            |
| 5.2  | Add `useFeatureFlag` hook and Pro-only feature stubs in `RulesPage` and `DashboardPage` |
| 5.3  | Create "Pro Feature" tooltip previews (blurred output + upgrade nudge)                  |
| 5.4  | Visually distinguish free vs. Pro simulations (e.g. single vs. Monte Carlo)             |

✅ **Exit Criteria**:

* App clearly communicates upgrade incentive
* Visual differentiation between free and Pro is intuitive
* Ready for Galileo monetization sprint without UX refactor
