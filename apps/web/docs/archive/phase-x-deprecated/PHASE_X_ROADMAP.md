## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation Guide**

### Design System Updates
```css
/* Example: Consistent button styling */
.btn-primary {
  background: var(--primary-color);
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding: 12px 24px;
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
}

.btn-primary:hover {
  background: var(--primary-color-dark);

  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
}
```

### Toast System Enhancement
```javascript
// Enhanced toast with different types
const showToast = (type, message) => {
  toast({
    title: type === 'success' ? 'Success' : 'Error',
