# AlphaFrame VX.1 CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

The AlphaFrame VX.1 CI/CD pipeline is a comprehensive automated workflow that handles code quality, testing, security scanning, performance monitoring, and deployment across multiple environments.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Workflow File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

The pipeline consists of 7 main jobs that run in parallel and sequence:

1. **Security Scan** - Vulnerability assessment
2. **Code Quality** - Linting and formatting checks
3. **Build & Test** - Multi-node testing and building
4. **E2E Testing** - End-to-end test automation
5. **Performance Testing** - Lighthouse CI analysis
6. **Staging Deployment** - Automated staging deployment
7. **Production Deployment** - Production deployment with releases

## Job Details

### 1. Security Scan
**Purpose:** Identify security vulnerabilities in dependencies
**Triggers:** All pushes and pull requests
**Actions:**
- Runs `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate`
- Fails pipeline if vulnerabilities found
- Prevents deployment of insecure code

### 2. Code Quality
**Purpose:** Ensure code meets quality standards
**Triggers:** All pushes and pull requests
**Actions:**
- Runs ESLint for code linting
- Checks Prettier formatting
- Scans for console.log statements in production code
- Enforces consistent code style

### 3. Build & Test
**Purpose:** Build and test across multiple Node.js versions
**Triggers:** All pushes and pull requests
**Dependencies:** Security Scan, Code Quality
**Matrix Strategy:** Tests on Node.js 16, 18, and 20
**Actions:**
- Sets up environment variables for testing
- Runs unit tests with coverage
- Uploads coverage reports to Codecov
- Builds application for each Node version
- Stores build artifacts for deployment

### 4. E2E Testing
**Purpose:** End-to-end testing with Playwright
**Triggers:** All pushes and pull requests
**Dependencies:** Build & Test
**Actions:**
- Downloads build artifacts
- Installs Playwright browsers
- Runs E2E test suite
- Uploads test reports and screenshots

### 5. Performance Testing
**Purpose:** Performance monitoring with Lighthouse CI
**Triggers:** All pushes and pull requests
**Dependencies:** Build & Test
**Actions:**
- Starts preview server
- Runs Lighthouse CI analysis
- Checks performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO scores
- Uploads performance reports

### 6. Staging Deployment
**Purpose:** Deploy to staging environment
**Triggers:** Main branch and VX.1 feature branch
**Dependencies:** Build & Test, E2E Tests, Performance
**Environment:** Staging
**Actions:**
- Downloads build artifacts
- Deploys to staging environment
- Ready for manual testing

### 7. Production Deployment
**Purpose:** Deploy to production with automated releases
**Triggers:** Main branch only
**Dependencies:** Build & Test, E2E Tests, Performance
**Environment:** Production
**Actions:**
- Downloads build artifacts
- Deploys to production environment
- Creates GitHub release with version tag
- Generates release notes

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables
The pipeline automatically sets up test environment variables:

```bash
VITE_AUTH0_DOMAIN=test.auth0.com
VITE_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=test-client-id
VITE_PLAID_CLIENT_ID=test-plaid-client
VITE_PLAID_SECRET=test-plaid-secret
VITE_PLAID_ENV=sandbox
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations
- **Development:** Local development with hot reload
- **Staging:** Production-like environment for testing
- **Production:** Live production environment
- **Test:** CI/CD testing environment

## Performance Standards

### Lighthouse CI Thresholds
- **Performance:** Minimum score 0.8 (warn)
- **Accessibility:** Minimum score 0.9 (error)
- **Best Practices:** Minimum score 0.8 (warn)
- **SEO:** Minimum score 0.8 (warn)

### Core Web Vitals
- **First Contentful Paint:** < 2000ms
- **Largest Contentful Paint:** < 2500ms
- **Cumulative Layout Shift:** < 0.1
- **Total Blocking Time:** < 300ms

## Security Features

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Automated dependency vulnerability checks
- Moderate-level security audit enforcement
- Pipeline failure on security issues
- Regular security updates

### Code Quality Gates
- ESLint enforcement
- Prettier formatting checks
- Console.log statement detection
- Consistent code style enforcement

## Deployment Strategy

### Staging Deployment
- Automatic deployment on feature branches
- Manual testing environment
- Pre-production validation
- Safe testing ground for new features

### Production Deployment
- Main branch only deployment
- Automated release creation
- Version tagging
- Release notes generation
- Rollback capability

## Artifact Management

### Build Artifacts
- Stored for 7 days
- Available for deployment jobs
- Node version-specific builds
- Optimized for deployment

### Test Reports
- Coverage reports uploaded to Codecov
- E2E test results stored for 30 days
- Performance reports available
- Screenshots and videos preserved

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Pipeline Monitoring
- Job status tracking
- Failure notifications
- Performance regression alerts
- Security vulnerability alerts

### Quality Gates
- All jobs must pass for deployment
- Security scan must pass
- Code quality checks must pass
- Performance thresholds must be met

## Configuration Files

### Lighthouse CI: `.lighthouserc.js`
- Performance testing configuration
- Score thresholds
- Test URLs and patterns
- Report upload settings

### Deployment Config: `deploy.config.js`
- Environment-specific settings
- Build commands
- Deployment targets
- Environment variables

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers
1. Push code to trigger pipeline
