 * 
 * Purpose: Will provide real-time rule evaluation and execution system that provides
 * immediate visual feedback when rules are triggered, creating the "Aha!"
 * moment where AlphaFrame becomes a genuinely trusted financial automation tool.
 * 
 * Current Status: All methods throw "Not yet implemented" errors
