// ExecutionController.js
// This module provides the executeAction function, which is responsible for executing an action in a given frame.
// It is exported as a named export to ensure it can be imported correctly in tests and other modules.

export function executeAction(frame, action) {
  // Implementation of executing an action in a frame.
  // This function takes a frame and an action as parameters and performs the necessary logic to execute the action.
  // For example, it might validate the action, check permissions, and then perform the action within the frame.
  console.log(`Executing action in frame: ${frame}, action: ${action}`);
  // Additional logic would go here.
}

// If there were other functions or constants to export, they would be listed here as well.
// For example:
// export const DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 5000;
