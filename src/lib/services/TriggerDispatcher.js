// TriggerDispatcher.js
// This module provides the clearActionQueue function, which is responsible for clearing the queue of actions in a given frame.
// It is exported as a named export to ensure it can be imported correctly in tests and other modules.

export function clearActionQueue(frame) {
  // Implementation of clearing the action queue in a frame.
  // This function takes a frame as a parameter and performs the necessary logic to clear the queue of actions.
  // For example, it might reset the queue or remove all pending actions.
  console.log(`Clearing action queue in frame: ${frame}`);
  // Additional logic would go here.
